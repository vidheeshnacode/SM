            "It is a type of test used to detect the presence of any specific genetic material in any pathogen (In this case, Virus). Originally, the method used radioactive isotope markers to detect targeted genetic materials. But subsequent refining has led to the replacement of isotopic labelling with fluorescent dyes. This allows scientists to see the results almost immediately while the process is still going on. With some adaptation this testing procedure was also used before for diagnosing other virus like Ebola and Zika Virus.\n",
            "\n",
            "Usually a virus consists either DNA or RNA as molecular envelop. SARS-CoV-2 only contains RNA, which means they rely on healthy cells to regenerate and survive. Thus to detect the RNA sequence of COVID-19, laboratory need to convert the RNA to DNA. This is where RTPCR comes to the picture. RT- Reverse Transcription does the conversion. Once this is done, scientist amplify the DNA several thousand times to specific sections to confirm presence of the virus.\n",
            "\n",
            "To start the test, samples are collected from person’s nose (Nasopharyngeal swab) or throat (Oropharyngeal swab). Once the specimen is collected, the swab is placed immediately into sterile tube containing a Viral Transport medium and sent to laboratory for testing. The sample is treated with several chemical solutions to separate RNA from protein and other substances. Then the RNA sequence is transcribed to DNA. Subsequently additional short fragments of DNA are added that are complementary to specific parts of the transcribed viral DNA. If the virus is present in a sample, these fragments attach themselves to target sections of the viral DNA. Some of the added genetic fragments are used for building DNA strands during amplification, while the others are used for building the DNA and adding marker labels to the strands, which are then used to detect the virus. The mixture is then placed in an RT–PCR machine. The machine cycles through temperatures that heat and cool the mixture to trigger specific chemical reactions that create new, identical copies of the target sections of viral DNA. The cycle is repeated over and over to continue copying the target sections of viral DNA. Each cycle doubles the previous number: two copies become four, four copies become eight, and so on. A standard real time RT–PCR set-up usually goes through 35 cycles, which means that, by the end of the process, around 35 billion new copies of the sections of viral DNA are created from each strand of the virus present in the sample. As new copies of the viral DNA sections are built, the marker labels attach to the DNA strands and then release a fluorescent dye, which is measured by the machine’s computer and presented in real time on the screen. The computer tracks the amount of fluorescence in the sample after each cycle. When a certain level of fluorescence is surpassed, this confirms that the virus is present. Scientists also monitor how many cycles it takes to reach this level in order to estimate the severity of the infection: the fewer the cycles, the more severe the viral infection is.\n",

At analysis of serial RT-PCR testing and CT scans, the mean interval between the initial negative to positive RT-PCR results was 5.1 days (+ or -) 1.5; the mean interval between initial positive to subsequent negative RT-PCR results was 6.9 days (+ or -) 2.3.

            "The current method of swabbing the patient for COVID-19 is mostly Nasopharyngeal. This was a retrospective analysis of 324 patients who had RT-PCR testing and HRCT were included in the study. HRCTs were classified as Category 1, 2 or 3. Patients were then divided into four groups based on HRCT category and RT-PCR swab results for analysis.\n",

            "A total of 161 patients tested positive by RT-PCR, while 156 were negative. 167 patients (52.02%) had Category 1 HRCT scans, 63 (19.63 %) had Category 2 scans and 91 (28.3%) had Category 3 scans. Sensitivity and specificity of HRCT was 77.6% and 73.7 respectively. The positive predictive value and negative predictive values of HRCT for COVID-19 were calculated at 75.3% and 76.2% respectively. Overall, 41 patients were diagnosed via HRCT and 168 via RTPCR swabs. Thus, 20% of total COVID cases that were declared negative by RT-PCR swab had characteristic findings of COVID-19 infection by HRCT.\n",

One should consider the CT scan results, CO-RADs classification and take the decision of treatment accordingly.\n",
